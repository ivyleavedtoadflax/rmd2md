## v0.1.4

* Fixed issue with images being saved to the wrong folder on linux (and implemeted new tests to ensure this is working correctly). Note that this is still not working fully on windows.
* Implementing build testing using appveyor for the windows environment.
* Removed the deprecated `url_images` argument from `rmd2md()`.
* Removed requirement for a published entry in the yml header. And will no longer alter this to published in the resulting `.md` file.
* `remove_exifs` now automatically detects operating system by default.
